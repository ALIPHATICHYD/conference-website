p A long standing gap has been filled! The AsyncAPI specification has risen as the industry standard for defining asynchronous APIs and is being incorporated into several products to enable a better tomorrow for Event-Driven Architecture (EDA).

I will focus on how you can use the tool to design your architecture and demonstrate how to use the AsyncAPIâ€™s Code Generators to quickly develop a Spring Cloud Stream microservice.
